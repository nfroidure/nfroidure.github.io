<h2>Unobtrusive Dependency Injection with Knifecycle</h2>
<p>
  I first used the dependency injection (DI) pattern with the AngularJS
  framework a few years ago. Since then, I am convinced it is one of the best
  design pattern out there, when used with caution. Here's why and how I finally
  bundled my own dependency injection library for JavaScript and NodeJS.
</p>
<h3>What is Dependency Injection?</h3>
<p>
  The
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection"
    title="Check the full definition on Wikipedia"
    >dependency injection pattern</a
  >
  aims to provide the states some code depends on. That way, the actual code is
  completely decoupled from its own dependencies implementation /
  initialization.
</p>
<p>
  People rarely have no advice on it, they often hate or love it, no mitigation
  there. I think it comes from the fact it really brings great powers but sadly
  it often forces you to respect a few annoying conventions on how you write and
  split your code.
</p>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
  First of all, let's briefly recall you the DI advantages. The DI comes with
  the idea that the applications life cycle usually is about initializing
  things, use it and finally free it.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="/images/dependency-injection.svg"
    alt="Application Lifecycle Timeline"
  />
</p>
<p>
  It may be databases, external APIs, RPC calls, anything implying IOs with the
  rest of the world. They are a bit special and this is why DI threat it
  differently than simple code libraries.
</p>
<p>
  Those dependencies are linked to each other so that we finally have an
  oriented dependency graph. The initialization and shutdown sequences are then
  resolving the graph in an optimized way with the best parallelism possible.
  This is the injector role to take care of it.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="/images/dependencies-graph-sequences.svg"
    alt="Dependencies graph initialization and shutdown sequence"
  />
</p>
<p>Basically, in JavaScript, DI looks like this:</p>
<code
  ><pre>
// With Classes
class User {
  constructor(db, log) {
    this.db = db;
    this.log = log;
  }
  async delete() {
    const result = await this.db.query('DELETE FROM users WHERE id = $id', { id });

    if (result.deletedRows) {
      this.log(`User ${id} has been deleted!`);
    }
  }
}

// With functions
async function deleteUser(db, log, id) {
  const result = await db.query('DELETE FROM users WHERE id = $id', { id });

  if (result.deletedRows) {
    log(`User ${id} has been deleted!`);
  }
}    
</pre
  ></code
>
<h4>The DI goodness</h4>
<p>
  Using DI allows you to just declare your services dependencies and delegate
  the startup and shutdown process to the injector. It saves you a lot of time
  and allows to focus on your actual business code.
</p>
<p>
  It also make your code more testable since you can easily replace a dependency
  per another (mocks, stubs).
</p>
<p>
  Making dependencies easy to substitute also leads to a more configurable code
  base. Your code base pieces are also more reusable.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, splitting your code into more specialized modules helps reducing the
  cognitive load of reasoning on its parts.
</p>
<h4>The DI downsides</h4>
<p>
  Usually, dependency injection with the help of an injector comes with
  downsides. First, it makes debugging harder since the code only express
  dependencies in a declarative way. That said, usually, injectors are bullet
  proof and some have a limited set of features reducing the bug risks.
</p>
<p>
  Also, when using types, since DI is dynamically done, you may loose some
  advantages of strong typing and static code analysis.
</p>
<p>Those downsides can be mitigated as we'll see later.</p>
<h3>Introducing Knifecycle</h3>
<p>
  When it comes to DI, most tools are levering <abbr>OOP</abbr> and decorators.
  While it may fit the needs of OOP lovers, I prefer using the function based
  approach where a service is simply initialized by an asynchronous function
  taking the service's dependencies in argument and returning the initialized
  service.
</p>
<p>
  Using functions also makes the code independent of the actual DI library
  since, you know, it's just functions and function can be called without any
  framework. One could just use those functions and initialize the process
  dependencies with actual code.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, I used to create my services that way and to create the
  initialization code by hand for years. The thing is that it is repetitive,
  error prone and create boilerplate that adds no value.
</p>
<p>
  I finally decided to automatize it but I didn't found a tool allowing DI usage
  without having to embrace a whole opinionated framework. I just wanted to use
  simple functions so I created one. Here comes,
  <a href="https://github.com/nfroidure/knifecycle">Knifecycle</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I like to refer to Knifecycle as the DI banana without the
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#cite_ref-armstrongjoe_39-1"
    >Gorilla</a
  >
  since most DI libraries are using OOP and I am really convinced it is a
  mistake.
</p>
<h4>Using Knifecycle</h4>
<p>
  Declaring a service is pretty simple actually, you just have to use the
  various functions that allows tagging initialization functions (called
  initializers) with the dependencies they actually need, the name and the kind
  of service it provides.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/nfroidure/d9fb9d2d40f0614ca9f31a75a3c5201d.js"></script>
<noscript
  ><code
    ><pre>
import { Knifecycle, constant, autoService, autoProvider } from 'knifecycle';

// Initialize the injector
const $ = new Knifecycle();

// Declare constants
$.register(constant('FTP_CONFIG', { user: 'test', password: 'test' }));
$.register(constant('DB_CONFIG', { user: 'test', password: 'test' }));

// Declare services
$.register(autoService(async function initFileServer({ FTP_CONFIG }) {
  let fileServer;
  
  // Actual initialization code 

  return fileServer;
}));

// Declare providers
$.register(autoProvider(async function initDatabase({ DB_CONFIG }) {
  let database;
  
  // Returning a structure describing the provider service and disposal
  return {
    service: database,
    dispose: async () => {
      // Do whatever needed to shut the db down properly here
    },
  };
}));

// Initialize root dependencies
$.run(['fileServer', 'database', '$shutdown'])
.then(({ fileServer, database, $shutdown }) => {
  // Do the actual program work here

  // Shutdown properly the process (will call dispose on every providers in order)
  // Useful for graceful stop
  return $shutdown();
});
</pre
    ></code
  ></noscript
>
<p>
  The reason why the <code>autoService</code> and <code>autoProvider</code> are
  prefixed by <code>auto</code> is that they infer from the function shape the
  names of the services and the dependencies they need from the functions
  signature. One could use the <code>service</code> and
  <code>provider</code> functions that basically do the same but in a more
  verbose manner. They can be useful to have more control on them though. That
  said, you can use the automatic versions and transpile it to the explicit ones
  by using the
  <a href="https://github.com/nfroidure/babel-plugin-knifecycle"
    >babel-plugin-knifecycle</a
  >
  module in your project's build.
</p>
<p>
  Knifecycle provides a lot of helpers you can find on the
  <a href="https://github.com/nfroidure/knifecycle#api">documentation</a>. Since
  services initializer are simple functions, there is a lot of functional
  programming concepts that applies to them (wrappers, compositions, piping...).
  Each decorators create a newly bound function so you can reuse an
  initialization function with different names and dependencies as many times as
  you need. For instance, in the previous example, if you needed to use the FTP
  service several times with different options you would just have to do the
  following:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/nfroidure/c4889b121a3a0146f2af4a7d99cd4a02.js"></script>
<noscript
  ><code
    ><pre>
import { Knifecycle, constant, autoService, service } from 'knifecycle';

// Initialize the injector
const $ = new Knifecycle();

// Declare constants
$.register(constant('FTP_CONFIG', { user: 'test', password: 'test' }));
$.register(constant('FTP_CONFIG2', { user: 'test2', password: 'test2' }));

// Declare services
$.register(autoService(async function initFileServer({ FTP_CONFIG }) {
  let fileServer;
  
  // Actual initialization code 

  return fileServer;
}));
$.register(
  service(initFileServer, 'fileServer2', ['FTP_CONFIG>FTP_CONFIG2'])
);

// Initialize root dependencies
$.run(['fileServer', 'fileServer2', '$shutdown'])
.then(({ fileServer, fileServer2, $shutdown }) => {
  // Do the actual program work here

  // Shutdown properly the process
  return $shutdown();
});
</pre
    ></code
  ></noscript

<h4>Addressing DI common downsides</h4>
<p>
  Sometime, using DI makes hard to figure out the final dependency graph since
  you just declare each piece of code's dependencies separately. Knifecycle
  provides a way to build graphs from your code for that purpose. You can see an
  example of those graph in the
  <a href="https://github.com/nfroidure/jsarch/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md"
    >jsarch architecture notes</a
  >. It is built using
  <a href="https://github.com/nfroidure/jsarch/blob/master/package.json#L38"
    >mermaid</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Another downside is the dynamic code that implies DI. Knifecycle allows you to
  build the
  <a
    href="https://github.com/nfroidure/knifecycle/blob/master/src/build.mocha.js#L72-L133"
    >injector code statically</a
  >
  so that you no longer need to embed Knifecycle in your final build. This is
  how I build the AWS Lambda functions of the Sencrop's backend. That way, the
  lambdas only contains the code they need to rely on. This is a nice side
  effect of limiting the DI influence on your own code.
</p>
<p>
  You can
  <a href="https://github.com/nfroidure/di-test">see a full repository</a> with
  Knifecycle usage example for a TypeScript project. It starts with no DI and
  then implement it with Knifecycle. In this post example, I declared the
  services manually but the injector can load the services automatically. This
  concept is
  <a
    href="https://github.com/nfroidure/di-test/blob/master/src/services/_autoload.ts"
    >also illustrated</a
  >
  in the above TypeScript project.
</p>
<p>
  I hope you'll find your own usage of
  <a href="https://github.com/nfroidure/knifecycle">Knifecycle</a>, I use it
  happily since 2 years now. If you want to try, feel free to reach me for help
  whenever you need some ;).
