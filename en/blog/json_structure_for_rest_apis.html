<h2>Normalizing JSON Data from REST APIs</h2>
<p><strong lang="en">
  TL; DR:<br />
  <pre>
{
  items: [1, 2, ...otherUsersIds],
  users: {
    '1' : {
      content: {
        id: 1,
        name: 'Popol',

        owner_id: 1
      }
    }
  }
}
  </pre>
</strong></p>
<p>
  I always wanted to write down this post on how I design JSON
  data on the REST APIs I build. At least for a reference to give
  to people that ask me why I'm doing it that way.
</p>
<p>
  If you didn't rage quit right after reading the TL;DR, then here is
  everything you have to know to understand the reasons behind those
  choices.
</p>
<h3>Normalization</h3>
<p>
  It is not about structuring or standardization, but really
  normalization like you would apply it to relational databases.
  Except that here, we are normalizing a single JSON.
</p>
<p>
  As you may know, in a lot of APIs, some additional resources are
  embedded with a given resource representation. Mainly, those have
  relations with it. For instance, a <code>GET /users/:userId</code>
  endpoint could embed the user's organization representation.
</p>
<p>
  One could say that it is a sign you need to use GraphQL. I wont be
  that categoric. I think it is convenient to add some related data in
  your JSON representations. In fact, RESTful principles allows several
  representations of the same resource.
</p>
<p>
  But a common mistake when doing so is to add the linked resource to
  the originating one as a property of it. It leads to content duplication.
  Indeed, if 2 users have the same organization, it will be embedded twice.
</p>
<p>
  You should now better understand this post's TL;DR. The JSON structure I use
  is avoiding duplication for linked resources.
</p>
<p>
  You'll also notice the collection items aren't directly
  put in the corresponding array. Only identifiers are there.
  The reason behind that is to allow having repeating collections.
  For instance, a <code>GET /usersQueue</code> endpoint could
  have the same user two times in the queue. The JSON format I
  use allows that without duplicating it. Finally, if a user
  owns the organization of the above example, then, you can
  easily find him from the organization owner identifier.
</p>
<p>
  You may wonder why I did not use
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-03">JSON
  reference</a>. The are 3 reasons for it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>first of all, I really want to use the native JSON deserializer
  on every browsers. For performance reasons of course. A browser is
  constantly parsing JSON data so I do not want to use a polyfill and
  do it with JS. With my way to set JSON data, resources are directly
  addressable though a hash, not more computing needed after parsing
  the JSON;</li>
  <li>also, having directly usable hashes, allows to combine them
  in order to optimize the front-end memory consumption. By
  maintaining objects stores, I can ensure the uniqueness of
  a single object across the whole application. With a simple
  <code>Object.assign</code> in my
  <a href="./considerations_for_generating_api_clients.html">API wrapper</a>
  or the use of weak sets where possible there are huge
  performance gains;</li>
  <li>finally, I do not want to pollute objects with their related
  resources which leads us to segregation.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>
  Segregation
</h3>
<p>
  Most resource representations contains two kinds of data.
  Normalized data are the ones you would store in a relational
  database. It is the source of truth, basically, the data CRUD
  operates on. In other words, the data PUT calls send to
  change a resource.
</p>
<p>
  This is why I put it in a <code>content</code> property.
  It is a convention to point out the data you could
  modify in your front-ends forms. It simplifies front-end
  development since they do not have to filter data.
  They just pick-up the content and build their forms
  around it.
</p>
<p>
  The other data are calculated ones. Those are only
  useful for display concerns. This is the case for
  the above avatar URL or for example for database
  modification/creation timestamps.
</p>
<h3>
  JSON schemas composition
</h3>
<p>
  I really like JSON schema. That said, I do not like to
  write them down ;). My JSON format allows to reuse
  definitions to avoid writing specific JSON schemas for
  each resource. Here is how I would define the above data
  format as a JSON Schema:
</p>
<pre>
  const userSchema = require('user');
  const organizationSchema = require('organization');
  const { idSchema, idPattern } = require('utils');

  module.exports = {
    title: 'Users collection',
    type: 'object',
    additionalProperties: false,
    properties: {
      items: {
        title: 'User\'s identifiers for the queried collection.',
        type: 'array',
        items: idSchema,
      },
      users: {
        title: 'Users hash',
        description: 'A hash containing users in the items collection.',
        type: 'object',
        patternProperties: {
          idPattern: userSchema,
        }
      },
      organizations: {
        title: 'Organizations hash',
        description: 'A hash containing organizations linked to users in the collection.',
        type: 'object',
        patternProperties: {
          idPattern: organizationSchema,
        },
      },
    },
  };
</pre>
<p>
  That's it! I hope you find that way of designing
  JSON data useful. Feel free to comment with your own
  tips!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Last minute addition :</strong><br/>
  Kévin Dunglas, a compatriot strongly involved in PHP/REST
  communities, cited the following standards a replacement
  for the structure I showed here:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD :</a> an
    alternative to using JSON Reference. What make me
    discarding it is the fact it nests actual data
    with its definition. It adds an overhead when
    serializing/deserializing and transporting the
    data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/">Hydra :</a>
    it is a layer over JSON-LD, discarding it per the above
    facts. It goes forward in a direction I do not approve.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL :</a>
    I didn't know it but just follow the link and scroll to the
    first JSON. Do you enjoy reading it ? I do not write APIs
    for bots, but rather for humans. That said, bots can have a
    look to my Swagger definition.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I did not mention Hypermedia APIs for brevity but of course
  we should all use it. That said, nowadays, any JSON browser
  can detect an URI without having to explicitly define it
  in the JSON. Anyway, bots can again read the Swagger definition
  if they are not smart enough to detect an URL.
</p>
<p>
  Swagger/OpenAPI are open standards allowing a lot of benefits
  from generating client to generating documentation. They
  benefit from a large set of tools built specifically for it.
  It is my standard of choice since it allows a clean separation
  between data and schemas while allowing developers to add
  their own value over it.
</p>
<p>
  I have a lot of respect for people involved in standardization.
  Any standard should, at least, be considered when designing
  systems. But I keep for myself the right to choose the one
  fitting my needs/wills. I wouldn't use XML again, neither
  <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS9H2Y_7.1.0/com.ibm.dp.doc/json_jsonx.html">JSONX</a>
  ;). Do not blindly follow standards but choose the one
  empowering you.
</p>
<p>
  I like Swagger because it is clear and light. It is like
  JavaScript: it helps reaching your goal without creating
  barriers. To be honest, I'm not that optimist about the
  OpenAPI initiative. I fear it takes a direction that is
  not compatible anymore with my concerns. But, maybe,
  another standard will come to rule all of them.
</p>

  <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">Source: XKCD</a>
</p>
<p>
  Finally, keep in mind that using standards is not the only
  way to go. Innovating often means the opposite. There are
  plenty of examples out there but let me cite the last one
  that just blown my mind and led me to reconsider, once
  again, a rock solid certitude:
