## Projects

I'm involved in a lot of different projects from add-ons to games, It's a good
way to stay informed on new development features and improve my skills.

I particularily like JavaScript, TypeScript and Rust languages.

### NodeJS

As as early NodeJS user, I made several modules I
[published on NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/~nfroidure 'View my NPM profile').

In particular, I like to create JavaScript parsers (CSV, VarStream, SVG...),
work with streams, make plugins and tools for developers.

### Web apps

I also build HTML5 games for fun and skills, like:

- [BeloreRE](https://belote.insertafter.com/): a simple franch card game (close
  to the bridge game),
- [Sumuraÿ](http://sumuray.insertafter.com/): a simple math game where you must
  find sums,
- [Memory](http://memory.insertafter.com/): a multiplayer memory game,
- [Break'It](https://breakit.insertafter.com/): a WTF breakit game.

I sometimes make some apps during hackathons with friends:

- [Trip Story](https://github.com/nfroidure/TripStory): a travel app made during
  a hackaton.

And other wierd stuff:

- [WEB MIDI Karaoke player](https://karaoke.insertafter.com/): a simple tool to
  Karaoke like in the 90's,
- [Hexadecimal Editor](https://hexa.insertafter.com/): a web based hexadecimal
  editor.

### Firefox / Chrome / Opera add-ons

If you are old enough and used to work with SEO/web contents, you may have used
some of my now unmaintained Firefox add-ons
([KGen](https://github.com/nfroidure/KGen),
[BBComposer](https://github.com/nfroidure/BBComposer),
[BugMeBack](https://github.com/nfroidure/BugMeBack) et
[CanImage](https://github.com/nfroidure/CanImage)), may they rest in peace.

[CapsKiller](https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/caps-killer/), a
Thunderbird add-on, is still alive but no maintenance either.

At the moment, only the Chrome version of
[BugMeBack](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bugmeback/hgmagcomobmjhaomdoihiggpdekaehmg?hl=fr)
and
[KGen](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kgen/jkpcelefglapiahikhocfdcigfpaagcl?hl=fr)
seems live but with no maintenance either.

### And many more
