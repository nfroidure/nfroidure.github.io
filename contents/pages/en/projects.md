## Projects

I'm involved in a lot of different projects from add-ons to games, It's a good
 way to stay informed on new development features and improve my skills.

### NodeJS

As as early NodeJS user, i made several modules i
 [published on NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/~nfroidure "View my NPM profile").

In particular, i like make JavaScript parsers (CSV, VarStream, SVG...), work
 with streams, make Gulp plugins and Express/Connect middlewares.

### Web apps

I also build HTML5 games for fun and skills, like:
* [Sumuraÿ](http://sumuray.insertafter.com/)
* [Memory](http://memory.insertafter.com/)
* [Break'It](http://breakit.insertafter.com/)
* [Tank Arena](http://tank.elitwork.com/) (work in progress).

I sometimes make some apps during hackathons with friends:
* [Trip Story](http://tripstory.insertafter.com/)

And other wierd stuff:
* [WEB MIDI Karaoke player](http://karaoke.insertafter.com/).
* [Hexadecimal Editor](http://hexa.insertafter.com/).

### Firefox / Chrome / Opera add-ons

On my freetime i like to experiment add-ons coding on modern browsers. It's
 an occasion to free myself of the odd Internet Explorer compatibility issues
 ;). You probably already eard about some of those add-ons:
 [KGen](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/kgen),
 [BBComposer](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/bbcomposer),
 [BugMeBack](https://github.com/nfroidure/BugMeBack)
 and [CanImage](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/canimage/).

But also for Thunderbird:
* [CapsKiller](https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/caps-killer/).

### And many more

You can get the source of my public projects in
