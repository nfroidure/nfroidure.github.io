<h2>Match IE8 with Rework and Gulp!</h2>
<p>Rework is a very powerful tool. It allows working with CSS contents in a friendly manner. Let&#039;s improve you IE8 compatibility with it.</p>

<p>I discovered <a title="Visit the rework repository" href="https://github.com/reworkcss/rework">Rework</a> recently thanks to the <a title="Read his blog post" href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/custom-css-preprocessing/">Nicolas Gallagher recent blog post</a>.
    It made me think about the recent ChtiJS build migration from Grunt to Gulp. One thing i did with our Grunt build was to <a title="See the concerned code" href="https://github.com/ChtiJS/chtijs.francejs.org/blob/223ba7bbce89d46ed08dd329dcf520ce92f812d1/grunt-config/website_build/build_front-tasks.js&#35;L3">create a IE8 specific CSS file</a>    by removing each rem units and replacing them with px units. It worked well but wasn&#039;t perfect since it didn&#039;t took in count the CSS syntax and could have lead to bugs for complex stylesheets.</p>
<p>On the other hand, give up rem units just for IE8 support is a bad idea. The rem unit system is really <a title="Look at this excellent article on font sizing with rem" href="http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem">powerful</a> when
    you want to size your contents. It gives you the em advantages without the well know nested em problems.</p>
<p>So i decided to create a Rework plugin in order to reproduce this behavior more safely. I called it <a title="See the public repository" href="https://github.com/nfroidure/rework-rem2px">rework-rem2px</a> and you can already find it on NPM. It works well,
    but the IE specific stylesheet were still containing some extra code, especially media queries that old IE version doesn&#039;t understand.</p>
<p>Thanks to the community, something already exists. <a title="See the queryless repository" href="https://github.com/iamdustan/queryless">css-queryless</a> remove media queries from a CSS file and also allows you to specify some expressions for wich you
    want to keep the media queries content in place that matches.</p>
<p>Ended up with this <a title="Look at the ChtiJS gulp build" href="https://github.com/ChtiJS/chtijs.francejs.org/blob/09c02aa9ab71fd324c61f917b907aafb706398ff/gulpfile.js&#35;L127">Gulp task</a>:</p><pre> // CSS<br />gulp.task(&#039;build_styles&#039;, function(cb) &#123;<br /> var keepmatches = &#91;<br /> &#039;screen and (min-width: 61rem)&#039;,<br /> &#039;print&#039;<br /> &#93;;<br /><br /> gulp.src(conf.src.less + &#039;/main.less&#039;)<br /> .pipe(g.less())<br /> .pipe(g.autoprefixer())<br /> .pipe(gulp.dest(conf.build.css))<br /> .pipe(g.rework(queryless(keepmatches), rem2px(16)))<br /> .pipe(g.rename(&#123;<br /> suffix: &#039;-ie&#039;<br /> &#125;))<br /> .pipe(gulp.dest(conf.build.css))<br /> .once(&#039;end&#039;, cb);<br />&#125;); </pre>
<p>Let me know you own tips to write modern CSS that work on IE8!</p>
