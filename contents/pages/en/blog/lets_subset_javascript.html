<h2>Let's Subset JavaScript</h2>
<p>
 TL;DR: Subsetting JavaScript is easy, you can do it with
 <a href="https://github.com/SimpliField/jsub"><code>jsub</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
  At <a href="http://www.simplifield.com">SimpliField</a>, we allow users to
  collect and analyse field data and as part of it, our users can create their
  own data models.
</p>
<p>
  As a consequence, we needed a solution that allows to define
  dynamically computed relational constraints. Things like dynamically define
  a form field as optional based on some conditions/computations.
</p>
<p>
  We ended up with a reliable solution based on a user interface and simple
  conditions. The problem we faced was that every new feature resulted in
  new complexity.
</p>
<p>
  We were also defining a new language our API consumers would certainly hate,
  once publicly available. And friends don't let friends struggling with bad
  APIs ;).
</p>
<h3>A few words about our stack</h3>
<p>
  We're using a full JavaScript stack (we call it MEANI for Mongo Express
  Angular NodeJS and Ionic). The big win of this kind of stack is not only
  isomorphism (I had great moments building the
  <a href="http://slides.com/nfroidure/reaccess">end-to-end user's rights
  management system</a> for our apps) but is mainly skill reuse.
</p>
<p>
  As a JavaScript developer, I can make some changes
  to the back-end and apply the resulting changes in both the front-end
  and the mobile app. It is really valuable as you don't have to rely on
  someone else to make a bunch of related changes.
</p>
<h3>Subsetting JavaScript</h3>

</p>
<p>
  So we choose to rely on JavaScript for conditionally displayed fields,
  computed fields, etc... The idea is simple: we need a formula language like
  those you can find in Open Office Calc or Microsoft Excel but we don't want to
  reinvent the wheel.
</p>
<p>
  We also want to have the minimal learning curve for developpers that will
  interact with our API. Since JavaScript was already a first class citizen in
  our stack, subsetting its syntax was in evidence.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks to the great <a href="http://esprima.org">Esprima project</a>, only a
  few hours were sufficient to create a first prototype of
  <a href="https://github.com/SimpliField/jsub">jsub</a>; a tiny project aimed
  to simply define a custom JavaScript subset.
</p>
<p>
  You basically define a set of conditions that shapes syntactically allowed
  expressions. Then, you check your script against those conditions and if
  something is going wrong, errors will simply show up.
</p>
<pre>
var simpleMath = {
  conditions: [{
    type: 'Program' // allow the root node
  }, {
    type: 'ExpressionStatement' // allow expressions
  }, {
    type: 'BinaryExpression', // allow the + and - operators
    operator: ['+', '-']
  }, {
    type: 'Literal',
    raw: /^([0-9]{1,5})$/ // allow positive numbers
  }]
};

var errors = jsub('(1 + 2) - 1', simpleMath);
assert.equal(errors.length, 0);
</pre>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>
  Having a custom syntax subsetting JavaScript provides a lot of out of the box
  advantages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Syntax highlighting: you can simply add highlighted syntax to your own
    API docs</li>
  <li>Hinting: what about a custom JSLint module to help your customers?</li>
  <li>Parsing: syntax errors will be the same than for JavaScript;</li>
  <li>No overhead: Just run it, especially if you are using the MEANI stack ;).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  There's probably a lot more things interesting with this approach let me
  know your thoughts.
